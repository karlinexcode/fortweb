                        The security of your data is important to us but remember that no method of transmission over
                        the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially

                        0.1. the right to access, update or to delete the information we have on you; <br>
                        0.2. the right of rectification. You have the right to have your information rectified if that

                        11. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) <br>
                        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services
                        to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person
                        or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting
                        personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy
                        policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with
                        whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. <br>
                        According to CalOPPA we agree to the following: <br>
                        0.1. users can visit our site anonymously; <br>
                        0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home
                        page of our website; <br>
                        0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page; <br>
                        0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at
                        info@syrexdigitalacademy.com.ng. <br>
                        Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals: <br>
                        We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not
                        Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web
                        browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked. <br>
                        You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web
                        browser. <br>
                        12. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) <br>
                        If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask
                        to delete your data and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can
                        make certain requests and ask us: <br>
                        0.1. What personal information we have about you. If you make this request, we will return to
                        you: <br>
                        0.0.1. The categories of personal information we have collected about you. <br>
                        0.0.2. The categories of sources from which we collect your personal information. <br>

                        of any other company we sold it to. If we have not sold your personal information, we will
                        inform you of that fact. <br>
                        0.0.7. A list of categories of personal information that we have disclosed for a business
                        purpose, along with the category of any other company we shared it with. <br>
                        Please note, you are entitled to ask us to provide you with this information up to two times in
                        a rolling twelve-month period. When you make this request, the information provided may be
                        limited to the personal information we collected about you in the previous 12 months. <br>
                        0.2. To delete your personal information. If you make this request, we will delete the personal
                        information we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records and direct any
                        service providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may be accomplished through
                        de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete your personal information, you may
                        not be able to use certain functions that require your personal information to operate. <br>
                        0.3. To stop selling your personal information. We don’t sell or rent your personal information
                        to any third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary
                        consideration. However, under some circumstances, a transfer of personal information to a third
                        party, or within our family of companies, without monetary consideration may be considered a
                        “sale” under California law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request
                        disclosure or deletion at any time. <br>
                        If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such
                        transfers. <br>
                        Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience
                        with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which
                        require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances, we will
                        discriminate against you for exercising your rights. <br>
                        To exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your request(s)
                        by email: info@syrexdigitalacademy.com.ng. <br>
                        Your data protection rights, described above, are covered by the CCPA, short for the California
                        Consumer Privacy Act. To find out more, visit the official California Legislative Information
                        website. The CCPA took effect on 01/01/2020. <br>
                        13. Service Providers <br>
                        We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (“Service

                        analysing how our Service is used. <br>
                        These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf
                        and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. <br>
                        14. Analytics <br>
                        We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service. <br>

                        We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to
                        our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their

                            20. Termination<br><br>

                            We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to Service immediately, without
                            prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without
                            limitation, including but not limited to a breach of Terms. <br>
                            If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using Service.<br>
                            All provisions of Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive
                            termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers,
                            indemnity and limitations of liability.<br>
                            21. Governing Law<br><br>

                            These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Nigeria, which
                            governing law applies to agreement without regard to its conflict of law provisions. <br>
                            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver
                            of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a
                            court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute
                            the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior
                            agreements we might have had between us regarding Service.<br>
                            22. Changes To Service<br><br>

                            We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service or material we
                            provide via Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any
                            reason all or any part of Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to
                            time, we may restrict access to some parts of Service, or the entire Service, to users,
                            including registered users.<br>
                            23. Amendments To Terms<br><br>

                            We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. It is your
                            responsibility to review these Terms periodically.<br>
                            Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised Terms means that you
                            accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page frequently so you are
                            aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.<br>
                            By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree
                            to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer
                            authorized to use Service.<br>
                            24. Waiver And Severability<br><br>

                            No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a further
                            or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition,
                            and any failure of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a
                            waiver of such right or provision.<br>
                            If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to
                            be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or
                            limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in
                            full force and effect.<br>
                            25. Acknowledgement<br><br>
